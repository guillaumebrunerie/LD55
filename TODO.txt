- When creating new game, donâ€™t show any wizard/runes
- When player joins, start all animations
- Sound triggers (also check sound for first 5 mana points?)
- Use same rules for both AI and against a player
- Make initial mana points appear at the same time as mushrooms
- Bug with MagicLoop that does not stop
- Handle reloading the page
- Handle restarting a new game, no animations currently

Need animations:
- Implement shield disappear/appear animations
- When creating new game, show posting
- Lobby: Join selects a player, Play starts the game
- Hamburger menu
